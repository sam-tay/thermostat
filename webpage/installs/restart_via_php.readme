To restart via php, the exec() or shell_exec() commands must be used. There will need to be super-user priviledges unless the following is done:

A slightly safer option would be to allow sudoers passwordless shutdown etc. That's easily accomplished: enter sudo visudo, add %sudo ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/poweroff, /sbin/halt, /sbin/reboot, save and exit. This way, a command-line reboot will still require sudo reboot, but you won't have to enter your password.
